TODOs and open issues
=====================

* random_reset : bool             Reasign irrelevant components with random values,
* Better incremental learning (more problem specific), rather break a huge incrementatl
into smaller chunks
* Adapatation of the scaling factor
* Warn about instabilities and critical factors
    * NaNs everywhere
    * sensitivity to scaling factor
    * degenerates
    * Pipeline setup needs to take care of matching number of components, dimensions
